‎2. Product Data Management
‎
‎How Products Are Stored
‎
‎All product information will be saved in a separate, editable file, for example: products.json
‎
‎Each product will have the following:
‎
‎name (always filled in, e.g., "mara")
‎
‎type (blank at first, later filled, e.g., "dress")
‎
‎color (e.g., "red", "blue")
‎
‎size (e.g., "M", "100ml")
‎
‎price (e.g., "1200 KES")
‎
‎image path (e.g., "images/mara.jpg")
‎
‎You (the owner) will:
‎
‎Add a product by entering its name in the file
‎
‎Fill in type, color, size, price later—even before image is ready
‎
‎Upload the image with a name that exactly matches the product name (e.g., mara.jpg) into the /images/ folder
‎
‎Image Handling
‎
‎Product images are matched by name: productname.jpg
‎
‎If an image file for a product is not found, a placeholder image should show instead
‎
‎Once the correct image is uploaded into the image folder, it will show up on the site automatically
‎
‎3. Order Button Logic
‎
‎Every product must have an order button
‎
‎When clicked, it should:
‎
‎Open WhatsApp
‎
‎Start a chat with number: 0702533122
‎
‎Have a message filled in like:
‎"Hello, I would like to order or discuss Mara."
‎(Replace “Mara” with that specific product name)
‎
‎4. Updating and Managing the Website (Owner Instructions)
‎
‎To add a new product:
‎
‎Go to the products.json file (or the file used to store products)
‎
‎Add a new entry with the product name only, leave the rest blank if needed
‎
‎Later, edit the entry and fill in type, size, color, and price
‎
‎Upload the image named exactly as the product name (e.g., mara.jpg) into the images/ folder
‎
‎After updating the file or uploading an image, changes should appear on the live site
‎
‎You do not need to edit any HTML or website code—only update the file and upload images
‎
‎5. Technical Suggestions
